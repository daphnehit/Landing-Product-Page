            <div class="content"> There are a whole lot of serums out there, from <strong> eyelash serum to hyaluronic acid serum to anti-ageing face serum.</strong> But what if you only have a room in your makeup bag for one? Experts say to go with vitamin C serum because it works.'Vitamin C is powerful antioxidant that fights fine lines  by stimulating collagen, brightens your complexion by blocking excess pigment creation, and protects the skin from damaging free radical and other environmental stressors.' says Michelle Henry, clinical instructor of dermatology at Weill Cornell Medical College. 'As we age,though, the skin's natural levels of antioxidant vitamin c decrease, which is why it's important to add it to your skin routine.' The one downside? Compared to most products, it often cost more per ounce. </div>

                    <p class="infotext"> The <strong> C E Ferulic serum didn't win an Allure Best of Beauty Award </strong> for four years for no reason. Editors and dermatology alike love it for it's fine line-smoothing powers, along with it's ability to dramactcally ligthen dark spots caused by sun damage. It's expensive, for sure, but you only need to use a couple pea-size drops for your entire face, so it should last a decent amount of time. Plus, when you start waking up to brighter, smoother skin everyday, you'll realize it's well worth the price. </p>

                    <p class="infotext"> SkinCeutical's new <strong>Silymarin CF</strong> is great option for those with oiy or acne-prone skin  as it combines vitamin c as L-abscorbic acid with siymarin, ferulic acid, and salicyclic acid, says board-certified dermatologist Marisa Garshick, M.D. Together, these ingredients provide antioxidant protection against free-radical damage while also helping to reduce oil and gently exfoliate. With continued use, Silymarin CF will improve your skin tone and texture, as well as reduce fine lines, wrinkles, and excess sebum production.</p>

                    <p class="infotext"> The name La Roche-Posay's Vitamin C Serum is as straightforward as it gets, unmistakely touting the formula's 10-percent ascorbic acid. But look a little closer and you'll find this rich liquid provides more than just vitamin C's benefits: Salicyclic acid helps with skin clarity, and hyaluronic acid ensures a boost of hydration. </p>
